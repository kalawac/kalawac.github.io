      Today, I ate an egg sandwich and dreamed of a world where I also had bacon 
      in the fridge. We started a personal portfolio coding project today. I'm really 
      anxious about what I'm going to write in the <strong><em>About Me</em></strong> 
      section. I put a placeholder sentence there for now.
