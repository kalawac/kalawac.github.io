      My son is obsessed with animals. They are his special interest and I am just 
      glad that there's a lot of variety in the animal kingdom. I'm never quite 
      sure whether he'll greet me with a regular human greeting, a neigh, a bleat,
      or, my least favorite, a rooster's crowing. There was a stretch where, every 
      time I tried to take a nap, he would claim to want to nap, too, and then lie 
      down for approximately 10 seconds before leaping up and crowing. It was not 
      cute.

      Anyway, we found out today that this project is just for funsies and not our 
      actual personal portfolio website. So freeing!
