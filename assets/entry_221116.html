      I just looked at my old stuff on codepen. LOL. So sedate compared to what 
      this project is going to be. Not hard to believe I created it six years ago. 
      I barely remember any of it.

      The transition to HTML5 has been less painful than I thought it might be. 
      VSCode, live server and the validation tools have taken a lot of the tedium 
      / guesswork out of the development process, as well. I'm glad for my prior 
      experience with HTML, though, because this week has moved quite quickly. 
      I feel a bit badly for my classmates figuring things out for first time. 
      A moment of silence for them.

      Now, back to figuring out how best to make this chaotic while also meeting 
      the project requirements.
