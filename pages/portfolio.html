        <p class="description">Includes two APIs that allow for the creation, reading, 
          updating and deletion of tasks and goals, which may be associated with each other.
          Tasks may be marked complete or unmarked complete (marked incomplete);
          the act of marking a task complete triggers the posting of an automated message
          to a slack channel. Goals can be queried to find the associated tasks.

          wants to watch, and recommendations from friends.
